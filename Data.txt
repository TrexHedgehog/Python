The reason we chose “boundary” is because seeing the theme of the 2023 conference, "Possibility," gave us some inspiration. They stated that at TED 2023 they want to explore a strange and beautiful space called possibly adjacent to the world that is not eaten up by zero-sum battles.TEDxUniversityofSheffield chose this theme because it encompasses various aspects of our world, including personal life, science, and globalization.
Boundaries can exist geographically as borders between countries or cities, or they can be cultural, linguistic, and traditional divides. These boundaries not only shape our sense of identity but also influence our communication with and understanding of others. However, with the advancement of globalization, the concept of boundaries has become increasingly blurred, and the world is no longer a zero-sum game. People need to rethink how to find balance in this diverse and interconnected world.
As a British international student, I have a close connection with the theme of "Boundaries." Firstly, I have personally experienced the challenges and opportunities of crossing geographical, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. This may include adapting to new lifestyles, habits, and social norms, as well as understanding and integrating into different cultural backgrounds. Such experiences have given me some understanding of the concept of boundaries. However, I also feel that my understanding of boundaries remains somewhat limited, so I aspire to connect with speakers from different fields to collectively explore the "boundaries" in their worlds and present a refreshing TEDx experience to the audience.
